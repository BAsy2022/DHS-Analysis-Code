Purpose: approximation of level-weight
Date: Jan 24, 2022

The purpose of this section is to support users regarding the approximation of level-weight of DHS surveys. 
The approximation follows the methods explained in the DHS Methodological Report #27: https://www.dhsprogram.com/publications/publication-mr27-methodological-reports.cfm?csSearch=423113_1

In addition to the provided Stata code, the user will need more information from the final report of the survey, especially from tables in Appendix A of the report.
The Stata code illustarte the approximation based on the household weight, hv005. 
The same code can be used to approximate level-weights based on other weights, such as v005 and mv005.
