Readme AS81

The code in the urbpov_code.do file can be used to construct the urban poverty measure used in the Analytical Study #81 "Urban Poverty and Child Health Indicators 
in Six African Countries with DHS Data". The resulting HR coded file can be merged with other file types (IR, KR, BR, PR, etc.) to study associations between urban 
poverty and standard DHS Indicators.
